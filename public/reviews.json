It comes in basically 4 components as follows: 1 metal fastener removal tool, a plastic bag with 4 plastic fastener removal tool, 10 fasteners with wire ties loosely flopping around in the cardboard delivery box, and 620 pieces of fasteners are in 3 interlocking compartmentalized plastic trays with a piece of paper on top identifying the fastener type, but not where each fastener is."

When I could find the few that were available, the prices were through the roof and they were being sold at a quantity of either two or three pieces in a pack at a cost of three to five dollars. Ridiculous! I don't know why I didn't check Amazon.com before spending all that money. I finally wised up and found this unbelievable deal on Amazon.com and jumped on it. "

        "description": "I was a little torn on this one between 4 and 5 starts given the price and amount of clips you get with the kit. The included metal tool is real nice and the clips seem good enough. It's just the case design I have issues with. You need to be extra careful each section is securely clipped before you pick the thing up from the handle to move it. In my case it was not and one section dumped out on the floor. So while it is a god kit and a good price, I have to take the one star for the case design. Still it is a good deal and I can recommend it to anyone needing a good assortment of clips and tools."
